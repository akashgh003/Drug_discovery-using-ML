# üöÄ In Silico Approach to Aid Alzheimer's Diseases Using Drug with ML Models üß†

![Project Overview](path_to_your_gif.gif)

## üß¨ Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects memory and cognitive functions. This project leverages machine learning (ML) models to identify potential drug candidates that could aid in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. By utilizing an in silico approach, we aim to streamline the drug discovery process, making it faster and more cost-effective.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/Drug_discovery-using-ML.git

#üöÄ Usage

    Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data by following the steps in the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook.
    Model Training: Train the ML models using the train_models.ipynb notebook.
    Evaluation: Evaluate the model performance using the evaluate_models.ipynb notebook.

##üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [source_name]. It includes various biochemical and pharmacological features of compounds known to interact with Alzheimer's disease-related targets. The dataset contains the following key components:

    Compounds: A collection of chemical compounds with potential therapeutic effects.
    Targets: Proteins and enzymes associated with Alzheimer's disease.
    Features: Biochemical properties, molecular fingerprints, and pharmacological descriptors of the compounds.

Data preprocessing involves cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction to ensure compatibility with machine learning models.
##üß† Models

This project utilizes a variety of machine learning models to predict the effectiveness of compounds in treating Alzheimer's disease. The models employed include:

    Random Forest: An ensemble learning method based on decision trees. It is robust against overfitting and performs well on large datasets.
    Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier that works well with high-dimensional data and is effective in cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.
    Neural Networks: A deep learning model capable of capturing complex relationships between the features and the target variables.

## Model Training

Each model was trained on a subset of the dataset, with hyperparameters tuned using cross-validation. The models were evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## üìù Results

The models were tested on a separate validation set to ensure unbiased evaluation. The results indicate that:

    Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 85% and an F1-score of 0.82, making it the best-performing model in this study.
    SVM provided a balanced accuracy of 83% with a slightly lower F1-score of 0.79.
    Neural Networks demonstrated strong performance with an accuracy of 80%, though it required more computational resources.

## Key Findings

    The Random Forest model identified several promising compounds that could be further investigated in clinical trials.
    The SVM model was particularly effective in identifying true positives, suggesting its utility in early-stage drug discovery.
    The Neural Networks model highlighted complex interactions between biochemical features that could be relevant for drug design.
